## What it does üí° 
<br>

Inclusiwealth is an educational web platform designed to empower users with a comprehensive suite of interactive tools and resources aimed at fostering financial literacy and inclusivity. At its core, Inclusiwealth offers a dynamic budget calculator, enabling users to efficiently track their income and expenses while receiving personalized suggestions on budget allocation. Additionally, our platform hosts a vibrant community forum where users can engage in meaningful discussions, seek advice, and share insights on various financial topics. Beyond these features, Inclusiwealth provides access to a wealth of educational materials, including curated lists of financial literacy books and courses, goal-setting worksheets, and finance trackers. Through its diverse array of offerings, Inclusiwealth equips users with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate their financial journey confidently and effectively, regardless of their background or level of expertise.

## Inspiration üöÄ 
Our inspiration stems from a blend of several topics, merging DEI initiatives with Finance and Customer Experience, particularly emphasizing community, to birth Inclusiwealth. This platform fosters inclusivity and empowerment, bridging gaps between underserved populations and mainstream finance. We envision a future where everyone, irrespective of background or socioeconomic status, can confidently take financial literacy by the horns and shape their own story.

## How we built it üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In building Inclusiwealth, we primarily utilized a range of front-end development tools and technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. We leveraged platforms such as GoDaddy for hosting, Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, and Figma for design prototyping. Additionally, we employed Replit liveshare as a development environment to streamline our coding process and enhance productivity. By focusing on front-end development, we aimed to create an intuitive and visually appealing user experience that aligns with our platform's mission of promoting financial inclusivity and empowerment.

## Challenges we ran into ‚õ∞Ô∏è
One challenge we encountered was enhancing the functionality of Inclusiwealth within the constraints of time. We recognized the potential for our platform to make a significant impact but faced limitations in the time available to fully realize our vision. Despite this challenge, we remained dedicated to our goal of creating a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for promoting financial inclusivity. We prioritized key features and optimizations to maximize our impact within the given timeframe, while also laying the groundwork for future development and expansion.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ü•á
We take pride in the collaborative effort that brought Inclusiwealth to fruition, ensuring its visual appeal and interactivity while addressing the significant issue of the DEI gap in finance. Our dedication to this cause extends to ongoing innovation, as we continue to seek solutions for future developments, staying committed to our mission of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in the financial landscape.

## What we learned üí≠
In the process of developing Inclusiwealth, we not only learned to work with new tools and software but also embraced the power of AI and co-pilot platforms to enhance efficiency. We learned to adapt quickly to unfamiliar technologies, effectively leveraging platforms like Figma for design prototyping and Replit for streamlined development. Collaborating with diverse team members taught us the importance of communication, flexibility, and collaboration in achieving our shared goals. Overall, our experience with Inclusiwealth has been a rich learning journey, reinforcing the value of continuous learning and collaboration in driving innovation and success.

## What's next for Inclusiwealth üîÆ
The future holds boundless possibilities for Inclusiwealth. While the platform is currently published, our vision extends far beyond its current state. We aspire to transform Inclusiwealth into a fully functioning and fully interactive platform, empowering real people to embark on their financial literacy journey with confidence and support.
